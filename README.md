# Playlist Manager
A playlist manager that controls (or creates on first usage) a playlist called 'Recent Songs' that contains the most recent songs saved by the user over a given time period. This tool uses the Spotify API to access and modify the playlist.

I am developing this tool because at times I want to listen to only my most recent music and having a playlist automatically created with my most recent music simplifies the process.

# Installation
(Work on this section of readme) <br>
Requires Express, cookie-parser, querystring, and request frameworks (download with npm).

To run this app, open terminal and on Unix/Linux machines run

This will run a local server on port 8888 so open a browser to:
